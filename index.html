<h2 >&nbsp<b>About My Website</b></h2>
<p class="hometext">
Have a look at my first attempt at web development and I'm open to suggestions. 
I'll be uploading new stuffs frequently on the site and will try to make it more interactive as and when I'll be learning new things related to
the course. Since, the layout hasnt been modified for mobile display, it's recommended to view the website in your laptops. Credits to COVID-19 
for giving me ample of time or else this website wouldn't have existed xD. You can always know more about me in the about section and can freely 
contact me through the contacts bar. Explore the website and provide your valuable feedback. Looking forward to meet you!! :-)
