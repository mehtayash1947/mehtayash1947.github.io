			<p>It saddens me that words like "Spirituality", "Meditation", "Yoga", "Tantra", etc. have been highly contaminated today. I'd much rather prefer to call them "Inner Exploration". These things have been a part of India since very long, and over the course of time, a lot of misinterpretation due to lack of context and ignorance has happened in these domains. </p>
			<p>So, to understand this domain of life in the correct context, it is necessary to tread cautiously and not to have any pre-conceived stereotypes.</p>
			<p>Befitting this, the first blog I have written is precisely on this topic. It is quite an eye-opener on how to approach this domain of life.</p>
			<h1>1) Interpreting Indian spirituality in its correct context</h1>
			<bul>A lesson in context :</bul>
			<p> A few years back, I was at a relative's house. It was a big family gathering and <i>Satyanaran Katha</i> was happening. It is one of the millions of rituals/processes that happen in India. The Maharaj who was conducting the katha was speaking and in the katha there was a small story : "A king got lost in the forest and after some wandering, saw a group of people conducting Satyanarayan katha and they offered him <i>prasadam</i> after the katha was over. The king was haughty and didn't want to accept food from lower-class people and denied the <i>prasadam</i>. Subsequently, the king somehow loses all his wealth, assets and kingdom because he refused to eat the <i>prasadam</i>."</p>
			<p> Have you not heard of similar stuff? Have your parents not told you to always eat <i>prasad</i> when you go to a <i>mandir</i> or a <i>pooja</i> happens? Of course, if any one of you questions it, the answer is more like a commandment and it strenghtens the impression you have in your mind that all of these things are stereotypes.</p>
			<p> The reason is the following : Back in the days, when a temple was constructed and if done so authentically, the <i>garbhagriha</i> (Sanctum sanctorum) contained the deity/idol which was energized (or consecrated) with <i>prana</i>. In fact the whole architecture of the temple is made in such a way so as to retain the energy for as long a period of time as possible. The deity is consecrated with a strong energy field and to ensure that this energy doesn't dissipate quickly with time, the architecture of the temple is done suitably. The <i>mandapam</i> or the tall dome above the South Indian temples is present directly above the <i>garbhagriha</i> and closely resembles the shape of a <i>lingam</i>. The <i>lingam</i> is the fundamental form which can retain <i>prana</i> for a long period of time. Since the deity in the <i>garbhagriha</i> is consecrated, it's energy field remains within the temple for a long period of time due to the <i>mandapam</i>. There are other factors that contribute too, like how the walls are constructed, architecture of other features of the temple like <i>gopuram</i>, etc.</p>
			<p> There have been many studies on how sound in a temple keeps ricochetting off the structure and stays for a considerably longer period of time than any normal construction/building is capable of. A link to this can be found <a href = "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270758839_ACOUSTICS_OF_CHANTS_CONCH-SHELLS_BELLS_AND_GONGS_IN_HINDU_WORSHIP_SPACES">here</a>. What applies for sound, similarly applies for <i>pranic</i> fields. The purpose of all this is that when people come to sit in the temple, they sit in a <i>pranically</i> charged atmosphere, thus enhancing their own energy-system and well-being.</p>
			<p> We are now zeroing in on our issue. People who established things like these were not madmen, please see. No one went about creating this concept of eating <i>prasad</i> without a good reason. What ideally happens in the case of <i>prasad</i> is, that after it is made, the <i>prasad</i> is kept right inside the <i>garbhagriha</i>, right near the energized deity for a certain period of time. Only after this is the <i>prasad</i> served to people. So what happens is, people are ingesting energized food, enhancing their <i>pranic</i> system.</p>
			<p> Please see, <i><b>almost all such so-called "rituals" or "practices" of Indian spiritual culture have been (not accidentally, not religiously, not stereotypically, but consciously and sensibly) made to enhance the energies of people.</i></b></p>
