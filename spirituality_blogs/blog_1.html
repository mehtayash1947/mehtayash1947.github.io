			<h1>1) Interpreting Indian spirituality in its correct context</h1>
			<bul>A lesson in context :</bul>
			<p> A few years back, I was at a relative's house. It was a big family gathering and <i>Satyanaran Katha</i> was happening. It is one of the millions of rituals/processes that happen in India. The Maharaj who was conducting the katha was speaking and in the katha there was a small story : "A king got lost in the forest and after some wandering, saw a group of people conducting Satyanarayan katha and they offered him <i>prasadam</i> after the katha was over. The king was haughty and didn't want to accept food from lower-class people and denied the <i>prasadam</i>. Subsequently, the king somehow loses all his wealth, assets and kingdom because he refused to eat the <i>prasadam</i>."</p>
			<p> Have you not heard of similar stuff? Have your parents not told you to always eat <i>prasad</i> when you go to a <i>mandir</i> or a <i>pooja</i> happens? Of course, if any one of you questions it, the answer is more like a commandment and it strenghtens the impression you have in your mind that all of these things are stereotypes.</p>
			<p> The reason is the following : Back in the days, when a temple was constructed and if done so authentically, the <i>garbhagriha</i> (Sanctum sanctorum) contained the deity/idol which was energized (or consecrated) with <i>prana</i>. In fact the whole architecture of the temple is made in such a way so as to retain the energy for as long a period of time as possible. The deity is consecrated with a strong energy field and to ensure that this energy doesn't dissipate quickly with time, the architecture of the temple is done suitably. The <i>mandapam</i> or the tall dome above the South Indian temples is present directly above the <i>garbhagriha</i> and closely resembles the shape of a <i>lingam</i>. The <i>lingam</i> is the fundamental form which can retain <i>prana</i> for a long period of time. Since the deity in the <i>garbhagriha</i> is consecrated, it's energy field remains within the temple for a long period of time due to the <i>mandapam</i>. There are other factors that contribute too, like how the walls are constructed, architecture of other features of the temple like <i>gopuram</i>, etc.</p>
			<p> There have been many studies on how sound in a temple keeps ricochetting off the structure and stays for a considerably longer period of time than any normal construction/building is capable of. A link to this can be found <a href = "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270758839_ACOUSTICS_OF_CHANTS_CONCH-SHELLS_BELLS_AND_GONGS_IN_HINDU_WORSHIP_SPACES">here</a>. What applies for sound, similarly applies for <i>pranic</i> fields. The purpose of all this is that when people come to sit in the temple, they sit in a <i>pranically</i> charged atmosphere, thus enhancing their own energy-system and well-being.</p>
			<p> We are now zeroing in on our issue. People who established things like these were not madmen, please see. No one went about creating this concept of eating <i>prasad</i> without a good reason. What ideally happens in the case of <i>prasad</i> is, that after it is made, the <i>prasad</i> is kept right inside the <i>garbhagriha</i>, right near the energized deity for a certain period of time. Only after this is the <i>prasad</i> served to people. So what happens is, people are ingesting energized food, enhancing their <i>pranic</i> system.</p>
			<p> Please see, <i><b>almost all such so-called "rituals" or "practices" of Indian spiritual culture have been (not accidentally, not religiously, not stereotypically, but consciously and sensibly) made to enhance the energies of people.</i></b></p>
			<p> Note that all this is describing what ideally happens. Originally, all of these things were carefully done and known by people. Over time, lots of distortions have happened. Today, very few temples are made such that the <i>prana</i> inside doesn't dissipate. Of course, for it to dissipate, first consecration has to be done. That itself is a question, as in how many of the temples have energized spaces inside? And with regards to <i>prasad</i>, who knows whether beteween your mouth and the kitchen there may be no intermediate stop.</p>
			<p> But anyway, the original way of doing these things is clear and very effective, if done properly. So, now think : is it true that you will lose your wealth and your wife and your house if you've been to a temple but refused to eat <i>prasad</i>? For God's sake, absolutely not. Then why is such nonsense being spread? Here is where context comes into play.</p>
			<p> India, for most part of it's history, had oral culture. Almost no written records. Teachings, stories, processes, etc. all was transmitted word-to-mouth. Context is very important, as to what kind of people were the audience. Most of the people had faith in God, but were not well-versed with inner science. Now, for such people, if I want to teach them a spiritual practice or tell them to do a certain process for their well-being, how do I convince them to do it? If I explain them all of this long stuff about the science of architecture of a temple for retaining vibrations, consecration of the deity and therefore the <i>prasad</i>, it won't work because these people have not experienced such things. How do I convince them that there is something called consecration, thtat there is something called <i>prana</i> when they haven't experienced it? Naturally, to make them do this, I have to come up with an explanation that they will be willing to fall for. These are simple people. So I say, if you don't eat the <i>prasad</i> the Gods will be displeased, misfortune will fall upon you, and so on and so forth. These are stories to make the people of the time start doing some spiritual processes for their well-being. It is not the objective truth. </p>
			<p> It is very much like poetry. How silly would someone be to take lines of a poem literally? If you read the following line : "Her eyes were deeper and bluer than the ocean" and you say "Hey what nonsense, the ocean is much deeper, what kind of comparison is this !" then you are an idiot. Because you have not understood the context, you have not understood the metaphor. You have taken it literally; it is not <b>meant</b> to be taken literally. Similarly, if someone says "If you go to a temple and don't eat the <i>prasad</i>, misfortune will fall upon your family." and you say "What nonsense !" then also you are an idiot. Because you haven't understood the context, the metaphor. You took it literally, it was not <b>meant</b> to be taken that way.</p>
			<p> There are many Sanskrit <i>mantras/stotras</i>. One of them is called <i>Lingashtakam</i>. In that, there is a line <i>"Janma-ja dukhha vinashana lingam, tatpranamami sadashiv lingam"</i> which means something along the lines that the <i>lingam</i> will destroy the sorrows of all your births, if you worship it. Technically speaking, absolute nonsense. But again, we are not supposed to take it literally. The shape of the <i>lingam</i> is such that it holds <i>prana</i> within it without dissipation which means, once consecrated, many people can benefit from its energy field by being in contact with it. But for the simple people who don't understand all this and hence this is not enough motivation for them to do it, these <i>stotras</i> are made. You tell them that all of your sorrows from all your births will be destroyed if you worship the <i>shivalinga</i>, and they'll swallow it up like Homeopathic tablets. </p>
			<p> This is the lesson in context. Of course, there are many other examples, which I could discuss with you if you are interested. All of this, I believe, should make sense to you. Except the part where I go into the hunky-dory stuff like <i>prana</i>, energy, consecration, etc. I am pretty sure you don't believe in all this. Naturally so, because you haven't experienced it. Specially for this, I have dedicated a short write-up <a href = "/blog_2.html">here</a>.
