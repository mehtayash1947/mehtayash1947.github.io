			<h1>Education</h1>
			
			<ul><li><bul>Pre-College: </bul></li></ul>
			<p>I attended 3 different schools before college, each starkly different in its culture, exposing me to various kinds of people, and I learnt a lot from all of that.</p>
			<p>A 4-year journey at Bothra Classes, a coaching institute for IIT-JEE, groomed my academic mind and helped me crack IIT-JEE and get into IIT Madras.</p>
			<ul><li><bul>IIT Madras: </bul></li></ul>
			<p>My experience here has been bittersweet. Fantastic institution as it is, I made fabulous and strongly-etched memories within my short 7-month sojourn here. But the Covid pandemic spoilt the show and it still stings how we were deprived of 1.5+ (and counting) years of our college life.</p>
			<p>But I do cherish the memories I made here, some of which I have mentioned in the Miscellaneous section. I had joined IIT Madras as a Mechanical Engineer but changed my branch to Electrical Engineering, which was great because I am much happier here.</p>
