			<h1>Mechanics of singing in <i>sur</i> : </h1>
			<p>Here, I will first briefly explain the concept of a control system, and how it is the basis of human singing. Thereafter, I will discuss how, the "ability" of singing "melodiously" by one's own will, is ultimately an outcome of how consciously one uses this control system. It is, in a way, the <b>root</b> of the problem of being <i>"besura"</i>. People try to conquer this problem in different ways, but without knowing how in fact they are solving the problem. </p>
			<bul>Control System</bul>:
			<p>For engineers, and especially Electrical Engineers, what I am about to say is bread-and-butter. So it's not needed for them to go through this part very carefully. But for people who are new to this concept, it is worth going through carefully.</p>
			<p>A Control System is a beautiful and fundamental concept which is used very very widely in almost all technologies. Its purpose is maintaining a particular parameter according to your wish, despite the vagaries of external influences. For example, you have a car which is going on a straight road and you wish to maintain it's speed at 30km/hr regardless of anything. Naturally, if you adjust the settings of it so that it starts going at 30km/hr, it's fine for a while, but when external vagaries like a strong opposing wind or a slight elevation in the road come, the speed is bound to change. The crux of the matter is, this is a real-life problem and there is no fixed formula that you can set and be assured that the car will keep moving at the same speed. Real-time monitoring is required.</p>
			<p>So, in a control system, there is a component which tells you "what is the value of the parameter <b>as of now</b>". At any time, what is the ideal value of the parameter is also known to the system. There is a "comparator" which compares these 2 values : what is and what ought to be. What actually happens is, it <b>subtracts</b> the actual value from the ideal value and feeds the result back (hence the term "negative feedback" : negative of the actual value added to the ideal value is fed back) to the component which is generating the parameter.</p>
			<p>An example : Car is supposed to maintain 30km/hr. Suppose right now, it is at 28 km/hr. So the value (<b>-28</b> + 30) = 2km/hr is fed back into the speed generator. So it knows that I need to increase the speed by 2km/hr. It does so, and hence the speed is maintained. Of course, it goes without saying that there are certain delays associated with these feedbacks, comparisons, etc. and hence the correction is not immediate but it happens reasonably well.</p>
			<p>While singing, our <i>sur</i> is maintained by the human control system.

			<p>The mechanism of singing in <i>sur</i> is the following :</p>
			<p>1) You should know how to increase or reduce the frequency of what you are singing.
			   2) You should know, by listening, what frequency this is. Not mathematically, but intuitively.
			   3) <b>Most important :</b> You should listen to yourself very carefully <b>while</b> you are singing.</p>
			<p>According to my observation and experience, the problem happens in the last 2 steps, and especially the last one. Cultivating the ability to know what frequency is this <i>sur</i> (intuitively) requires patience and practice. However, I have seen many people who fulfill the first 2 steps quite nicely but still don't sing very well in <i>sur</i> because they don't implement the 3rd step very nicely. </p>
			<p>Everyone does implement the 3rd step, but sensitivity is what makes the difference. In fact, the control system lies in the 3rd step !! How will you know whether you are going out of <i>sur</i> and how will you correct it if you are not listening to yourself very carefully while you are singing? If you don't listen to yourself while you are singing, basically you are blocking the feedback loop as described in the diagram. So the control system is blcked, hence there is no correction. If there is no real-time correction, it means you are all on your own : if you are singing in <i>sur</i> straightaway all the time, only then you will be fine. But rarely does that happen. </p>
			<p><u>"The most melodious singers are not those who can sing any <i>sur</i> at will perfectly; they are the ones who implement their control system and feedback loop in the most sensitive manner." </u> Even if you are implementing the control system, how sensitively you are implementing it determines how much "in <i>sur</i>" you will be able to sing.</p>
			<p>In a Sarb Akal baithak, I have heard the late legend Pt. Rajan Mishra saying the following : "<i>Sirf rukna seekh lee jiye zindagi me, sab kuchh pata lag jaayega. Thoda ruk ke khaana khaayiye, svaad badal jaayega. Thoda ruk ke chalen, thokar nahi lagega.</i>" It applies for the control system. Sing, but do it dexterously. If you sing consciously, and listen to your own voice <i>at the same time</i> as you are singing, then it means your feedback is very sensitive - hence your 3rd step is fulfilled. Of course, you still definitely need the knowledge of identifying whether you are wrong or not, and by how much (point no. 2) and then if you are wrong, then corrercting it (point no. 1).</p>
			<p>This is the mechanics of singing in <i>sur</i>. This is not a fancy theory I have made up. This is what actually happens when musicians sing. There is always a slight fringing when they sing a particular note. If one wants to sing a note which is at a frequency of, say 432 Hertz, then for a certain period of time, you will produce frequencies slightly less or slghtly more than 432, before finally settling to 432. That period of time is the correction period. If your control system is very sensitive (which means you are listening to yourself consciously and dexterously while singing, which most good singers do) then that time period of settling is of the order of milliseconds or less. If it is slightly insensitive, then it takes longer to settle. However, if you are simply not listening to yourself (feedback loop blocked), or, you are listening to yourself but do not have the knowledge of identifying <i>sur</i> (point no. 2 unfulfilled) or have no ability to correct (point no. 1 unfulfilled, which is quite rare), then the settling period is infinite, or in other words, you are not singing the note which was intended, that is, you have gone <i>"besura"</i>.</p>
