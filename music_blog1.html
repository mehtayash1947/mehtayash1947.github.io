			<h1>Mechanics of singing in <i>sur</i> : </h1>
			<p>Here, I will first briefly explain the concept of a control system, and how it is the basis of human singing. Thereafter, I will discuss how, the "ability" of singing "melodiously" by one's own will, is ultimately an outcome of how consciously one uses this control system. It is, in a way, the <b>root</b> of the problem of being <i>"besura"</i>. People try to conquer this problem in different ways, but without knowing how in fact they are solving the problem. </p>
			<bul>Control System</bul>:
			<p>For engineers, and especially Electrical Engineers, what I am about to say is bread-and-butter. So it's not needed for them to go through this part very carefully. But for people who are new to this concept, it is worth going through carefully.</p>
			<p>A Control System is a beautiful and fundamental concept which is used very very widely in almost all technologies. Its purpose is maintaining a particular parameter according to your wish, despite the vagaries of external influences. For example, you have a car which is going on a straight road and you wish to maintain it's speed at 30km/hr regardless of anything. Naturally, if you adjust the settings of it so that it starts going at 30km/hr, it's fine for a while, but when external vagaries like a strong opposing wind or a slight elevation in the road come, the speed is bound to change. The crux of the matter is, this is a real-life problem and there is no fixed formula that you can set and be assured that the car will keep moving at the same speed. Real-time monitoring is required.</p>
			<p>So, in a control system, there is a component which tells you "what is the value of the parameter <b>as of now</b>". At any time, what is the ideal value of the parameter is also known to the system. There is a "comparator" which compares these 2 values : what is and what ought to be. What actually happens is, it <b>subtracts</b> the actual value from the ideal value and feeds the result back (hence the term "negative feedback" : negative of the actual value added to the ideal value is fed back) to the component which is generating the parameter.</p>
			<p>An example : Car is supposed to maintain 30km/hr. Suppose right now, it is at 28 km/hr. So the value (<b>-28</b> + 30) = 2km/hr is fed back into the speed generator. So it knows that I need to increase the speed by 2km/hr. It does so, and hence the speed is maintained. Of course, it goes without saying that there are certain delays associated with these feedbacks, comparisons, etc. and hence the correction is not immediate but it happens reasonably well.</p>
			<p>While singing, our <i>sur</i> is maintained by the human control system.
