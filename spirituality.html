			<p>It saddens me that words like "Spirituality", "Meditation", "Yoga", "Tantra", etc. have been highly contaminated today. I'd much rather prefer to call them "Inner Exploration". These things have been a part of India since very long, and over the course of time, a lot of misinterpretation due to lack of context and ignorance has happened in these domains. </p>
			<p>So, to understand this domain of life in the correct context, it is necessary to tread cautiously and not to have any pre-conceived stereotypes.</p>
			<p>Befitting this, the first blog I have written is precisely on this topic. It is quite an eye-opener on how to approach this domain of life.</p>
