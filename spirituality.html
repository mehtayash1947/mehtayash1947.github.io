			<p>It saddens me that words like "Spirituality", "Meditation", "Yoga", "Tantra", etc. have been highly contaminated today. I'd much rather prefer to call them "Inner Exploration". These things have been a part of India since very long, and over the course of time, a lot of misinterpretation due to lack of context and ignorance has happened in these domains. </p>
			<p>So, to understand this domain of life in the correct context, it is necessary to tread cautiously and not to have any pre-conceived stereotypes.</p>
			<p>Befitting this, the first blog I have written is precisely on this topic. It is quite an eye-opener on how to approach this domain of life.</p>

			<bul>A lesson in context :</bul>
			<p> A few years back, I was at a relative's house. It was a big family gathering and <i>Satyanaran Katha</i> was happening. It is one of the millions of rituals/processes that happen in India. The Maharaj who was conducting the katha was speaking and in the katha there was a small story : "A king got lost in the forest and after some wandering, saw a group of people conducting Satyanarayan katha and they offered him <i>prasadam</i> after the katha was over. The king was haughty and didn't want to accept food from lower-class people and denied the <i>prasadam</i>. Subsequently, the king somehow loses all his wealth, assets and kingdom because he refused to eat the <i>prasadam</i>."</p>
			<p> Have you not heard of similar stuff? Have your parents not told you to always eat <i>prasad</i> when you go to a <i>mandir</i> or a <i>pooja</i> happens? Of course, if any one of you questions it, the answer is more like a commandment and it strenghtens the impression you have in your mind that all of these things are stereotypes.</p>
