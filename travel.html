			<p> I don't remember most of my travels before I passed 12th standard. It's partly because I don't have many pictures of them, partly because I hadn't had very strong experiences then and wasn't too fond of travelling then to be honest, and partly because it's simply been a long time. </p>
			<p> Travelling and intra-city roaming took a Quantum leap after giving JEE Advanced, which still continue to this day. I have spent a mammoth amount of time roaming in Ahmedabad and in IIT Madras.</p>
			<p> I am extremely fond of Himalayan trekking. I have been on 2 treks till now : DC (Deoriatal-Chandrashila) and Rupin Pass. They were absolutely sensational experiences. They are the only ones worth mentioning here :)</p>
			<h1> Deoriatal-Chandrashila : </h1>
			<p>Although I have technically done trekking in Manali (in 8th grade) and Shimla (in 11th grade), that is not a genuine high-altitude trek. Those are hill stations and nowadays, no more than picnic spots. </p>
			<p>My first proper high-altitude trek was DC in December 2020, after the first Covid wave. This is in Uttarakhand. The major highlight of this trek was the Chandrashila summit and the summit climb in the wee hours of 3AM - 7AM. A few pictures : </p>
