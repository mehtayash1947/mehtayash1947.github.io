			<p>I have been fortunate enough to have been persuaded by my parents to learn Hindustani Classical vocal. I have been learning Hindustani Classical Vocal since the 2nd grade, which (without any ego, but simply stating the facts) makes my 12+ years (and counting) experience in the field.</p>
			<p>Many people approach this field in a casual way and skim only the surface, but, as one of the all time legends of Classical Music Pt. Rajan Mishra's father (another legend) Pt. Hanuman Prasad Mishra used to say, <i>"Beta, abhi sur ki chont lagi nahi hai, fir dekho apne aap riyaz karne lagoge"</i>. It means there comes a turning point in the journey of a student of Indian Classical Music when he/she starts to clearly see the magnanimity and the delicate, intricate and grand web of <i>sur</i>. That is when addiction starts; then music starts to flow in his veins, so to say.</p>
			<p>I also have an avid interest and play a decent standard of Tabla, and listen to other Hindustani Classical instruments, especially Flute, Santoor, Sitar and Sarod. </p>
			<p>Here, I have tried to pen down some of my thoughts and insights related to Music, many times specific to Hindustani Classical. These things I have very carefully written from my deep experience and are very <b>esoteric</b> so I expect you to do your part too by reading them with all your attention, carefully and with an open mind. Please feel free to reach out to me regarding any concerns/criticism/doubts regarding the same.</p>
		
			<h1>Mechanics of singing in <i>sur</i> : </h1>
			<p>Here, I will first briefly explain the concept of a control system, and how it is the basis of human singing. Thereafter, I will discuss how, the "ability" of singing "melodiously" by one's own will, is ultimately an outcome of how consciously one uses this control system. It is, in a way, the <b>root</b> of the problem of being <i>"besura"</i>. People try to conquer this problem in different ways, but without knowing how in fact they are solving the problem. </p>
