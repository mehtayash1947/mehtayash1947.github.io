			<p>I have been fortunate enough to have been persuaded by my parents to learn Hindustani Classical vocal. I have been learning Hindustani Classical Vocal since the 2nd grade, which (without any ego, but simply stating the facts) makes my 12+ years (and counting) experience in the field.</p>
			<p>Many people approach this field in a casual way and skim only the surface, but, as one the all time legends of Classical Music Pt. Rajan Mishra's father (another legend) Pt. Hanuman Prasad Mishra used to say, <i>"Beta, abhi sur ki chont lagi nahi hai, fir dekho apne aap riyaz karne lagoge"</i>. Very few people invest a good amount of time into Indian Classical Music, but even among them, a very scarce number of people are blessed to have been hit with "<i>sur ki chont</i>". I am very fortunate to have experienced it.</p>
			<p>I also have an avid interest and play a decent standard of Tabla, and listen to other Hindustani Classical instruments, especially Flute, Santoor, Sitar and Sarod. </p>
			<p>Here, I have tried to pen down some of my thoughts and insights related to Music, many times specific to Hindustani Classical. These things I have very carefully written from my deep experience and are very <b>esoteric</b> so I expect you to do your part too by reading them with all your attention, carefully and with an open mind. I do not expect more than a very small percentage of people to really understand them. Nevertheless, they are here for anyone's knowledge; please feel free to reach out to me regarding any concerns/criticism/doubts regarding the same.</p>
